	abstract = {•A sparse-tree model is formulated and utilized as additional prior for signal recovery from a small number of measurements.•A novel tree-based recovery algorithm, the Tree-based Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TOMP) algorithm, is proposed to recover signals with sparse-tree priors.•An implementation of the algorithm based on Gram–Schmidt process is presented in detail.•The proposed method gives reconstruction quality comparable to more sophisticated algorithms at less computational cost.},
