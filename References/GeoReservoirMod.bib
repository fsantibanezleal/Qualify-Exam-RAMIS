abstract = {This book is a guide to the use of inverse theory for estimation and conditional simulation of flow and transport parameters in porous media. It describes the theory and practice of estimating properties of underground petroleum reservoirs from measurements of flow in wells, and it explains how to characterize the uncertainty in such estimates. Early chapters present the reader with the necessary background in inverse theory, probability and spatial statistics. The book demonstrates how to calculate sensitivity coefficients and the linearized relationship between models and production data. It also shows how to develop iterative methods for generating estimates and conditional realizations. The text is written for researchers and graduates in petroleum engineering and groundwater hydrology and can be used as a textbook for advanced courses on inverse theory in petroleum engineering. It includes many worked examples to demonstrate the methodologies and a selection of exercises.},

@article{Scheidt2009_a,
	abstract = {
Assessing uncertainty of a spatial phenomenon requires the analysis of a large number of parameters which must be processed by a transfer function. To capture the possibly of a wide range of uncertainty in the transfer function response, a large set of geostatistical model realizations needs to be processed. Stochastic spatial simulation can rapidly provide multiple, equally probable realizations. However, since the transfer function is often computationally demanding, only a small number of models can be evaluated in practice, and are usually selected through a ranking procedure. Traditional ranking techniques for selection of probabilistic ranges of response (P10, P50 and P90) are highly dependent on the static property used. In this paper, we propose to parameterize the spatial uncertainty represented by a large set of geostatistical realizations through a distance function measuring “dissimilarity” between any two geostatistical realizations. The distance function allows a mapping of the space of uncertainty. The distance can be tailored to the particular problem. The multi-dimensional space of uncertainty can be modeled using kernel techniques, such as kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) or kernel clustering. These tools allow for the selection of a subset of representative realizations containing similar properties to the larger set. Without losing accuracy, decisions and strategies can then be performed applying a transfer function on the subset without the need to exhaustively evaluate each realization. This method is applied to a synthetic oil reservoir, where spatial uncertainty of channel facies is modeled through multiple realizations generated using a multi-point geostatistical algorithm and several training images.
