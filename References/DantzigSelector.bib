is much larger than the number of observations n. Suppose then that we have observations y = X*Beta+ z, where Beta is a parameter vector of interest, X is a data matrix with possibly far fewer rows than columns, n p, and the z\_i's are i.i.d. N(0, sigma 2). Is it possible to estimate reliably based on the noisy data y?}},
