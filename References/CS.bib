abstract={This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f∈CN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=στ∈Tf(τ)δ(t-τ) obeying |T|≤CM·(log N)-1 · |Ω| for some constant CM>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|·logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|·logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

abstract = "Abstract This work proposes a new approach for multichannel facies image reconstruction based on compressed sensing where the image is recovered from pixel-based measurements without the use of prior information from a training image. An l 1 - minimization reconstruction algorithm is proposed, and a performance guaranteed result is adopted to evaluate its reconstruction. From this analysis, we formulate the problem of basis selection, where it is shown that for unstructured pixel-based measurements the Discrete Cosine Transform is the best choice for the problem. In the experimental side, signal-to-noise ratios and similarity perceptual indicators are used to evaluate the quality of the reconstructions, and promising reconstruction results are obtained. The potential of this new approach is demonstrated in under-sampled scenario of $2–4$ \% of direct data, which is known to be very challenging in the absence of prior knowledge from a training image.
